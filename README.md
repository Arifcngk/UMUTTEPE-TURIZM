Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive bus ticketing platform developed using the Laravel framework. It features a three-panel system catering to different user roles: mobile app for passengers, web interface for bus conductors, and an admin panel for system management.

Key Features

Passenger Mobile App: Designed to provide passengers with a user-friendly interface for browsing, comparing prices, and booking bus tickets seamlessly. Passengers can create accounts, manage bookings, and make secure payments through the app.

Conductor Web Interface: Enables bus conductors to manage bus schedules, check passenger bookings, and ensure smooth boarding processes. Conductors can update ticket availability, verify bookings, and mark boarding statuses.

Admin Panel: The admin panel offers comprehensive control over the system, allowing administrators to manage bus routes, set ticket prices, view transaction logs, and monitor user activity. It provides insights into system performance and facilitates effective management of the platform.

Technologies Used

The project leverages the Laravel framework for its robust backend infrastructure, ensuring scalability and maintainability. MySQL is utilized as the database management system to store user data, ticket information, and system logs. The frontend interfaces are developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience across devices.
